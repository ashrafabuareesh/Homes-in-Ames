# Homes-in-Ames
We've been hired by a group of homeowners concerned about their homes' value decreasing before they sell them. They have asked us to take the raw house price data from their hometown, Ames, Iowa to give them data-driven recommendations on how to increase the value of their home.

goal is: Increase the resale value of homes. Homeowners can make more informed decisions about renovations and upgrades based on predicted future trends in housing prices. They can prioritize renovations that are likely to yield the highest returns on investment, thereby increasing the overall value of their homes
